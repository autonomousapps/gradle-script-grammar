# Gradle Build Script Grammar

This library can parse Gradle build scripts, written in either Groovy or Kotlin (`build.gradle` and `build.gradle.kts`).

This library is forked from https://github.com/square/gradle-dependencies-sorter, and is intended to ultimately replace
its `:grammar` subproject.
